# Task 1: Single Web Infrastructure Design

## Components and Functions

- **Server**: Manages actions, handles user requests, and stores data.
- **Domain Name**: Acts as a web address pointing to a server's location on the internet.
- **DNS Record**: Associates the domain with an IP address (e.g., CNAME record).
- **Web Server**: Receives requests from web browsers and serves webpage content.
- **Application Server**: Hosts website/application logic, including user authentication and data processing.
- **Database**: Stores and manages data for retrieval.
- **Communication Protocol**: Utilizes HTTP or HTTPS for communication between server and client.

## Challenges and Issues

1. **SPOF (Single Point of Failure)**: Risk of website downtime if the server fails.
2. **Downtime during Maintenance**: Website inaccessible during updates or fixes.
3. **Scalability Issues**: Inability to handle high traffic loads efficiently.
